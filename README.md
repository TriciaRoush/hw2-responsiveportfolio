# hw2-responsiveportfolio
This project is a rudimentary junior developer's portfolio that must be mobile responsive as well. I created my HTML index as well as the accompanying contact, portfolio & CSS files.  I added the navbar and sticky/fixed footer with consistancy to each html file, ensuring each link to each respecive file worked properly.  My next step was to add content to each page by what their title denotes respectively.  I added custom CSS on my stylesheet to give alll the pages some cohesiveness.  Lastly, I was personalizing the "About Me" content but did not budget my time enough and fell short at this juncture.
